Slide 1
=======
    Absolute with level 0 beginners.
    Start with printing “hello world” to web development.
    Each module comes with Hands-on session. Encourage to do code along with instructor.
    Questions to be dropped in webex chat.
Slide 2 
=======
    Anaconda - Spyder
    Pycharm
    Python Interpreter IDE
    Python cmd prompt
    Google collab
    Any online python interpreter
    Ask everyone to verify hello world and confirm!
    
Slide 3
=======

    Reliable - Sleeping for 30 years – So language is not important - Logical thinking over Language - Feed your logical thinking into any syntax instead of one programming language.
    
Eg. Finding first recurring character in a string – ABCABNA
Naive Way – Self join – Cons: loop runs C(n,2) i.e O(n^2) 
efficient way - using dictionary - check if the char exists in dict. If no, insert it. If yes, then thats the res. worst case runs O(n)

So Dont pet any language or get attached to it. Instead increase aptitude.


   OOPS - Its oops in its own way – access modifiers - choose as per need.

    R Vs Python - R is more of a calculator for Data Scientists and less of a programmming langauge.
Eg. 2 + 2 = ? Vs Mean of a population in Binomial distribution when sample is known.
Sounded geek? Vollyball example - if it was played 25 weeks in an year and what is the probability that it will played this week?

and Python is more of a scripting language for Programmers.
Eg. Repetitive tasks.

1. Web Development - Django/Flask 
2. ML
	Normal program - take a pic of an Cat and program that lot of white furs to be identified as a cat
	ML program - What about black, grey and colored cats? What about different sizes of cat?
	Feed 1000s of cat pics into a learning algorithm , train it, fit it, optimize it for errors and make it identify input pic.
	Eg. Recommendation engines - Netflix, Amazon, etc or Autopilot in EVs
3. Data Analytics and Visualization
	Normal program - Take a day of crowd coming into wallmart and show a bar diagram that more women shopped Vs men.
	DA and Vis - what if it happened by chance? or it happened only on a Sunday and not other days?
	Collect more data and all day graph on same diagram
4.Scripting - automated tasks - daily programs.

Less popular appls
1.Gaming system - Pygame
2.Desktop appns - Java, C++ are preferred
3.Embedded programming 





1. Given a score sheet of a quiz test, find the runner up score.
Learns slicing operator, map, sorting and set datatype

Hint - List will have duplicates.

    n = input()
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print (sorted(set(arr))[-2])


2. word count program
Learns Dictionary datatype, split and loops

def word_count(str):
    counts = dict()
    words = str.split()

    for word in words:
        if word in counts:
            counts[word] += 1
        else:
            counts[word] = 1

    return counts

print( word_count('the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'))

3.Given a 2D matrix, create a list of all the odd numbers present in the matrix sorted in descending order. 
Learns 2D lists, list comprehension and list sorting

myMatrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4],
            	[5, 6, 7],
            	[8, 9, 10]]
myList = [i for row in myMatrix for i in row if i % 2 != 0]
myList.sort(reverse=True)
print myList

4. Printing hash value of tuple
Learns tuple datatype and mutable/immutable objects

hash() returns hashed value only for immutable objects, hence can be used as an indicator to check for mutable/immutable objects.
for encoding

    n = int(input())
    integer_list = map(int, input().split())
    print (hash(tuple(integer_list)))

5.Create a dictionary of all words from the input paragraph, which are having 4 or more characters in it . 
Key of the dictionary should be word and value should be the number of times that word has appeared in the paragraph.  
Learns Dictionary datatype and loops
eg. {"feminist":3,"part":2,"campaign":1} 
mySentence="Adrift in space with no food or water, Tony Stark sends a message to Pepper Potts as his oxygen supply starts to dwindle. Meanwhile, the remaining Avengers Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Bruce Banner must figure out a way to bring back their vanquished allies for an epic showdown with Thanos the evil demigod who decimated the planet and the universe"

mySentence="Adrift in space with no food or water, Tony Stark sends a message to Pepper Potts as his oxygen supply starts to dwindle. Meanwhile, the remaining Avengers Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Bruce Banner must figure out a way to bring back their vanquished allies for an epic showdown with Thanos the evil demigod who decimated the planet and the universe"
myDict = {}

for word in mySentence.split(" "):
    if len(word) >= 4:
        if word not in myDict:
            myDict[word] = 1
        else:
            myDict[word] += 1
print myDict

6. Given a list like myList=[1,2,3,4], find sum of each number with another number, i.e., 1+2,1+3,1+4,2+3,2+4,3+4 . 
Learns nested for loop and if loop

myList=[1,2,3,4]
arrayLength =  len(myList)
for i in range(arrayLength):
    for j in range(arrayLength):
        if j>i:
            print myList[i]+myList[j]
